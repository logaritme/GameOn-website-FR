# Projet GameOn

## This project is the forth project of the OpenClassRooms training to be a web developper front-end.

## It consists on take over writing the code of someone else to continue writing it and solve issues.

### 1. This repository has been fork from https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/GameOn-website-FR ;

### 2. I used VSCode to code this form on the website GameOn;

### 3. This projetc has no dependencies ;

### 4. For this project I used only personalised CSS and pure JavaScript interacting with the DOM ;

### 5. All the issues solved were pushed on main/master of my fork since in reality my code will not be merged, but if that had been the case it would have been necessary to push all the issues on a branch.
